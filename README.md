# MSCSUP-AMS
Final_Project

Our Municipal of Sta. Cruz Sports Committee Program and Activity
Monitoring System with Online Registration
implements several security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity:

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: All forms and state-changing requests include CSRF tokens validated on the server side to prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Session Management**: Secure, HTTP-only cookies are used for sessions, with session regeneration to prevent fixation attacks.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: User inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` function with the bcrypt algorithm.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control restricts user permissions and prevents unauthorized data access.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed errors are logged server-side, while user-facing messages are generic to avoid information disclosure.
- **Secure File Uploads and QR Code Handling**: Uploaded files and QR code data are validated and sanitized to prevent injection and malware risks.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting the project maintainer directly rather than posting it publicly. Your responsible disclosure helps protect users.

If you want, I can help you draft a full README template for your entire project including:

- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage
- Features
- Security notices (with your specific security code explanation)
- Contribution guidelines
- License info

Would you like me to do that? Or just the security part for now?

$user = 'root';
$pass = '';
$dbname = 'sports_monitoring';
üöÄ 6. Run the System
Open a browser and go to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost/your-project-folder/
üîê 7. Default Login (If applicable)
